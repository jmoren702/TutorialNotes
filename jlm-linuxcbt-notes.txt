###Linux - User Administration###

1. Add, Remove and Modify users
 a. User = account
 b. Only root (sudo user) can administer users/groups
  b1. Commands = useradd, usermod, userdel (in /usr/sbin)
  b2. Default config files for new users = /etc/skel
 c. Passwords can be changed en-mass by using the following command:
     chpasswd < /path/to/pwfile  
  c2. Example PW File format:
     jmoren:changed01
     rsmith:changed02
     tjohnson:changed03
  d. User info stored in /etc/passwd, password (encryted) stored in /etc/shadow
2. Groups  - Users can be aded to groups
  a. Group info stored in /etc/group, password (encypted) stored in /etc/gshadow
  b. Add user to group = usermod -G username
3. Permissions (Modes)
 a. Seperate permissions for: User, Group, Other - ls -l shows permissions (modes)
 b. Changing file permissions = chmod g+w filename - adds write permission to group of 	    file.  
  b1. chmod  ug=rw filename - resets permissions of filename completely,          gives user  and group read and write permissions to file.
  b2. chmod 754 filename - uses permission binary to modify permissions od file.  754 gives RWX to User, R+X for Group and R for Other
 c. Directory Modes - Full Access -> rwx, Limited (Enter,Read) -> r-x, No Access -> ---



###Filesystems and Security###

1. Partition creation tools - mkfs, fdisk, fsck
 a. fdisk -l = Lists existing partitions on current disk
 b. fdisk - enters fdisk command menu - m (help, displays commands)
 c. mkfs - Creates partitions/filesystems on disk (ie EXT4, NTFS, etc)
 d. fsck - Checks filesystem for errors - To use this tool, umount then re-mount filesystem as RO then run   fschk
2. mount/umount - Mounts and unmounts filesystems, partitions and devices to local dirs such as /mnt/dir
 a. Mount CVDROM drive:  mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom0 /mnt/cdrom
 b. umount /mnt/cdrom - Unmounts CDROM device
3. df,du - df, reports system disk size, du, reports system directory size (ie - du -h /home/jmoren = displays size of /home/jmoren dir in human-readable format) - see man pages for more info on each
4. /mnt - System dir that is typically the mount location for mounted partitions
5. /dev - System dir that contains device files (ie - hda = local hard disk, etc)

6. Linux Directory Structure
 /bin  - critical/commonly used binary executable files (ie - ls, less, more, cd, etc)
 /boot - boot files
 /etc  - system/application config files
 /dev  - device files such as hda1 or cdrom0
 /home - user profile dires and files
 /lib  - shared application libraries
 /mnt  - where media gets mounts typically 
 /opt  - location for pre-packaged 'optional' applications typically get ginstalled (ie - google chrome gets installed here)
 /proc - contains system process files such as processor, memory allocation, current running processes, etc
 /root - rot user home dir 
 /var  - variable dir that contains rapidly or frequently changing files (ie - log, database, print spool, etc)
 /sbin - system administration utilities
 /tmp  - temporary files dir - any user can write to this dir
 /usr  - user-specific data or utilities (ie - /usr/sbin contains user-specific sysadmin utilities such ass useradd or usermod)
   /usr/bin - less-critical binary files (ie - clear, compilers, etc)
   /usr/include - if you want to include a specific function such as a specific C function
 
7. Security
 a. Common security tasks - remove dormant accounts, get users to choose strong passwords
 b. Remove unnecessary programs
 c. Check default user permissions - umask values in /etc/profile - umasy -S
 d. Check /etc/shadow file - check permissions for this file, make sure its read only by root only
  d1. Check permissions on the /usr/bin/passwd command (check other files for 's' permissions should ONLY be set on internal commands such as passwd!


###Networking###

--Overview--
1. Hardware - Ethernet over CAT6 -> Switch -> Router -> Switch
2. Packets  - Segments of data carrie over the wire - contains 'header' info that moves packet to its destination
3. Protocols - TCP, IP, UDP, etc - 
4. Addressing - hardware(MAC address), IP addresses->DNS<-hostnames

--Configuration--
1. Red Hat uses a tool called netconfig -
 a. can also use ifconfig to config interfaces: 
    ifconfig eth0 up 10.1.160.159 netmask 255.255.255.0
    route add default gw 10.1.160.1
    /etc/resolv.conf:  add following to add DNS servers: nameserver 10.1.160.5
--Remote Access--
1. Telnet - NEVER USE THIS, password is sent in plain text!!  Use SSH.
2. FTP (CLI), gftp (graphical FTP application)
Controlling Access
1. Firewall
 a. IP Tables
--Remote Admin--
1. SSH


###Linux Essentials###
--X Windows--
1. X Server - xfree86, xserver.org
2. Window Manager - GTK, Ice, etc - Look and feel
3. Desktop Environment - Gnome, KDE, etc - graphical utilities, apps, etc

--Shell Scripting--
1. "Sh-Bang" (Sharp character followed by exclamation point) starts a shell script = #!/bin/bash
ex script =
	#!/bin/bash
	# Shell script comments start with sharp/pound sign
        echo "This is a shell script!"
	echo "Prett cool heh?"   #You can add comments on the same line as code too!
 a. Variables can be used - declare them with '$' - example = $var_name
ex script using variable =
	#!/bin/bash
	var_name="Jeff is cool!"
	echo $var_name
2. To execute script use sh or ./ - ie sh script_name.sh OR ./script_name.sh
